Comment=Após pressionar Alt+Ctrl+H, a entrada 'Hello' será simulada, como se você a tivesse digitado. Isto é especialmente útil se você precisa digitar frequentemente uma palavra (por exemplo, 'unsigned'). Cada tecla pressionada na entrada é separada por dois-pontos ':'. Observe que as teclas pressionadas significam realmente teclas pressionadas, então você tem que escrever o que queria realmente pressionar no teclado. Na tabela abaixo, a coluna da esquerda mostra a entrada e a coluna da direita mostra o que foi digitado. \n\n"enter" (por exemplo, nova linha)                Enter or Return\na (por exemplo, 'a' minúsculo)                          A\nA (por exemplo, 'a' maiúsculo)                       Shift+A\n: (dois-pontos)                                  Shift+;\n'  (espaço)                              Espaço

Comment=Leia o comentário sobre a ação "Digitar 'Hello'" primeiro.\n\nO Qt Designer usa Ctrl+F4 para fechar as janelas. No KDE, entretanto, o Ctrl+F4 é o atalho para ir à área de trabalho virtual 4 e, por isto, o atalho não funciona no Qt Designer. Além disso, o Qt Designer não usa o Ctrl+W padrão do KDE para fechar a janela.\n\nEste problema pode ser resolvido com o remapeamento do Ctrl+W para Ctrl+F4 quando a janela ativa for o Qt Designer. Quando o Qt Designer está ativo, toda vez que Ctrl+W é pressionado, Ctrl+F4 será enviado alternativamente para o Qt Designer. Em outros aplicativos, o efeito do Ctrl+W é inalterado.\n\nAgora precisamos especificar três coisas: Um novo atalho de ativação para o 'Ctrl+W', uma nova ação de entrada do teclado que envia o Ctrl+F4, e uma nova condição de que a janela ativa é o Qt Designer.\nO Qt Designer parece sempre ter o título 'Qt Designer by Trolltech' e, por isto, a condição irá checar se a janela ativa tem aquele título.

Comment=Leia o comentário sobre a ação "Digitar 'Olá'" primeiro.\n\nAssim como a ação "Digitar 'Olá'", esta simula uma entrada de teclado, especificamente, após pressionar Ctrl+Alt+B, ela envia B para o XMMS (B no XMMS salta para a próxima música). A caixa de verificação 'Enviar para uma janela específica' é marcada e uma janela com esta classe contendo 'XMMS_Player' é especificada; isto fará com que a entrada seja sempre enviada para esta janela. Desta forma, você pode controlar o XMMS mesmo se ele estiver, por exemplo, em uma área de trabalho virtual diferente.\n\n(Execute 'xprop', clique na janela XMMS e procure por WM_CLASS para ver 'XMMS_Player').

Comment=O Konqueror no KDE3.1 tem abas, e agora você também pode ter gestos.\n\nApenas pressione o botão do meio do mouse e comece a desenhar um dos gestos, e após você ter terminado, solte o botão do mouse. Se você apenas precisa colar a seleção, isto ainda funciona, apenas clique com o botão do meio do mouse. (Você pode trocar o botão do mouse a usar nas configurações globais).\n\nAté o momento, existem os seguintes gestos disponíveis:\nmover para a direita e voltar para a esquerda - Avançar (Alt+seta direita)\nmover para a esquerda e voltar para a direita - Retroceder (Alt+seta esquerda)\nmover para cima e voltar para baixo - Subir (Alt+seta para cima)\ngirar no sentido anti-horário - Recarregar (F5)\n\nAs formas dos gestos podem ser indicadas executando-as no diálogo de configuração. Você também pode olhar o seu teclado numérico para ajudá-lo, gestos são reconhecidos como uma grade de 3x3 campos, numerados de 1 a 9.\n\nObserve que você precisa executar o gesto de forma exata para disparar a ação. Por isso, é possível indicar mais gestos para a ação. Tente evitar gestos complicados onde você troca a direção do movimento do mouse mais de uma vez. (por exemplo, 45654 ou 74123 são simples de efetuar, mas 1236987 pode ser relativamente difícil).\n\nAs condições para todos os gestos estão definidas neste grupo. Todos estes gestos estão ativos apenas se a janela ativa é o Konqueror (a classe contém 'konqueror').
